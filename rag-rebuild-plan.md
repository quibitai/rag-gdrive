# RAG Chatbot Comprehensive Rebuild Plan

## Overview
This plan combines the best elements from both previous plans, addressing critical issues while implementing systematic improvements. The implementation follows a phase-based approach spread across 10 weeks.

## Critical Issues to Address
1. Node-specific imports causing client-side errors (e.g., `node:buffer` in `websocket.ts`)
2. Separate WebSocket server creating maintenance challenges
3. Inefficient document processing (sequential execution, excessive updates)
4. Poor error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. Suboptimal search capabilities (vector-only)

## Phase 1: Foundation Rebuild (Weeks 1-2)

### 1.1 WebSocket Integration and API Routes
- Replace standalone WebSocket server with Next.js App Router API routes
- Create `src/app/api/websocket/route.ts` with proper Edge Runtime support
- Implement isomorphic WebSocket client in `src/lib/websocket-client.ts`
- Replace Node-specific imports with browser-compatible alternatives
- Ensure backward compatibility during transition

### 1.2 Database Integration
- Integrate SQLite for document catalog storage (replacing JSON file)
- Create data access layer for catalog operations
- Implement migration from existing JSON catalog to SQLite
- Add transaction support for atomic operations

### 1.3 Core File Processing Rewrite
- Enhance error handling in file operations
- Implement proper path resolution for files with spaces/special characters
- Add robust validation for file operations
- Create detailed logging system for debugging

## Phase 2: Document Processing Enhancement (Weeks 3-4)

### 2.1 Parallel Processing Implementation
- Create `src/lib/worker-pool.ts` for controlled concurrency
- Implement task queue and worker management
- Add configurable batch processing with Promise.all()
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### 2.2 Intelligent Chunking Strategy
- Enhance document splitters to respect document structure
- Implement sentence and paragraph-aware splitting
- Vary chunk size based on document type and content density
- Add semantic chunking for better context preservation

### 2.3 Progress Tracking System
- Implement detailed progress tracking with percentage-based updates
- Create batch-level and file-level progress reporting
- Add estimated time remaining calculations
- Optimize WebSocket updates to prevent flooding

## Phase 3: RAG Enhancement (Weeks 5-6)

### 3.1 Hybrid Search Implementation
- Integrate BM25 keyword search alongside vector embeddings
- Modify `src/lib/vector.ts` to combine both search approaches
- Create query analyzer to determine optimal search strategy
- Implement weighted result combination based on query type

### 3.2 Context Retrieval Enhancement
- Create `src/lib/query-planner.ts` for multi-hop questions
- Analyze query complexity to determine retrieval strategy
- Implement step-wise retrieval for complex questions
- Update prompt templates with improved instructions

### 3.3 Vector Storage Optimization
- Implement efficient vector storage and retrieval
- Add caching for frequent queries
- Optimize embedding generation for speed

## Phase 4: Real-time UI and Monitoring (Weeks 7-8)

### 4.1 State Management
- Implement proper state management (Zustand)
- Create centralized store for application state
- Add action creators and reducers for UI operations
- Ensure consistent state across components

### 4.2 Enhanced UI Components
- Improve file status visualization with detailed progress indicators
- Create processing pipeline visualization
- Implement animated status indicators for real-time feedback
- Add interactive elements for system management

### 4.3 System Health Dashboard
- Create admin dashboard with system health metrics
- Implement performance visualizations
- Add usage statistics and popular queries tracking
- Create component-level health indicators

## Phase 5: Google Drive Integration (Weeks 7-8)

### 5.1 Delta Updates for Large Files
- Enhance Drive sync with differential downloading
- Implement checksum comparison for detecting changes
- Add range requests for partial file downloads
- Track modified sections to update only changed parts

### 5.2 Improved Folder Structure Handling
- Enhance folder mapping with better hierarchy preservation
- Implement path normalization across platforms
- Add integrity checks for folder structure
- Preserve Drive folder IDs for tracking

## Phase 6: Security and Optimization (Weeks 9-10)

### 6.1 Authentication and Authorization
- Implement user authentication with OAuth or email/password
- Add session management with secure cookies
- Create role-based access controls
- Update UI for authenticated state

### 6.2 Caching and Performance
- Add caching layers for frequent operations
- Implement Redis or similar for distributed caching
- Optimize resource usage and database queries
- Add performance monitoring and bottleneck detection

### 6.3 Testing and CI/CD
- Create comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, E2E)
- Implement GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
- Add Docker configuration for deployment
- Implement automatic version management

## Implementation Priorities

### Immediate (Week 1)
- Replace Node-specific imports with isomorphic alternatives
- Integrate WebSocket functionality into Next.js API routes
- Fix file path handling for spaces and special characters

### Short-term (Weeks 2-4)
- Implement worker pool and parallel processing
- Enhance error handling and recovery
- Integrate SQLite database

### Medium-term (Weeks 5-8)
- Implement hybrid search capabilities
- Enhance context retrieval and chunking
- Improve real-time UI components
- Enhance Google Drive integration

### Long-term (Weeks 9-10)
- Implement authentication and security features
- Add caching and performance optimizations
- Create comprehensive test coverage
- Set up CI/CD pipeline

This phased approach addresses critical issues first while systematically improving all aspects of the application over the 10-week timeline.
