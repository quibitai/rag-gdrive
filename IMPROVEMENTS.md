# Improvements in Version 2.1.1

## File Path Structure Improvements

In version 2.1.1, we've addressed a significant issue with the file structure in the RAG Chatbot application. Previously, files from nested folders (particularly those from the Admin/Financials folder and its subfolders) were incorrectly appearing in the root directory in the dashboard view.

### The Problem

Files imported from Google Drive were not maintaining their proper folder structure in the file catalog. This resulted in:

1. A cluttered root directory with hundreds of files
2. Loss of organizational structure from the original Google Drive
3. Difficulty in finding specific documents
4. Poor user experience when browsing the file tree

### The Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive fix with the new `fix-file-paths.js` script (v2.1) that:

1. **Intelligently categorizes documents** based on their filenames and content
2. **Restores proper folder hierarchy** for financial documents and client files
3. **Provides detailed statistics** on file path updates
4. **Creates timestamped backups** before making changes to the file catalog

### Key Features of the Fix

#### 1. Smart Document Categorization

The script analyzes filenames to determine the appropriate folder for each document:

- **Financial Documents**: Invoices, billing statements, estimates, quotes, contracts, etc.
- **Client Documents**: Project briefs, proposals, timelines, reports, etc.
- **Other Documents**: Any remaining uncategorized files

#### 2. Hierarchical Folder Structure

Documents are organized into a logical folder structure:

```
Admin/
  └── Financials/
      ├── Billing/
      ├── Estimates_and_Quotes/
      ├── VENDORS_accounts/
      ├── Employees_and_Contractors/
      ├── Insurance/
      ├── Government_Documents/
      └── Contracts_and_Agreements/
ET_Clients/
  ├── Louisiana_Charter_Boat_Association/
  ├── Walkons/
  ├── Relief_Windows/
  ├── CPRA/
  ├── LPB/
  └── Other_Clients/
General_Documents/
```

#### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

The script includes robust error handling to:

- Recover from corrupted file catalog JSON
- Attempt restoration from backup files
- Provide clear error messages
- Create timestamped backups before making changes

#### 4. Detailed Statistics

After running the script, users receive detailed statistics about the changes made:

- Total number of files processed
- Number of financial documents categorized
- Number of client documents organized
- Number of other documents placed in general folders
- Number of files skipped (already had paths)

### How to Use

To fix file paths in your catalog, simply run:

```bash
node scripts/fix-file-paths.js
```

After running the script, restart the server to see the changes in the dashboard.

### Future Improvements

For future versions, we plan to:

1. Implement automatic folder structure maintenance during Google Drive sync
2. Add a UI option to reorganize files directly from the dashboard
3. Support custom folder mappings via configuration
4. Enhance the file explorer with search and filter capabilities

## Other Improvements in v2.1.1

- Enhanced error handling throughout the application
- Improved backup mechanism with timestamped backups
- Updated documentation with more detailed usage instructions
- Fixed minor UI issues in the dashboard
